Chip - Starter Application.  This is the starter package for building and testing modules built for the ecosystem

## Meteor framework
Meteor is an ultra-simple environment for building modern web applications.

With Meteor you write apps:

- in modern JavaScript
- that send data over the wire, rather than HTML
- using your choice of popular open-source libraries

## Quick Start
1. Install Meteor
2. Install all NPM dependencies
3. Run application

On Linux/macOS, use this line:

`curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`

To install all NPM dependencies:

`meteor npm install`

To run application in development:

`meteor npm run start`

To run application in production:

`meteor npm run prod`

## How AOT works?

- On both server and client, it loads AOT-compiled factories by using angular-compiler

## How Universal works?

- renderModule(JIT) and renderModuleFactory(AOT) with Meteor's server-render

## Known issues

- Working progress
